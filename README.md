# remodel-tutorials
We've assembled some cheat sheets, references, and tutorials for learning to use RosettaRemodel as a command line executable here in this repo. They're meant to supplement, not replace, the documentation kept at RosettaCommons:

[RosettaRemodel Docs](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/design/rosettaremodel)  
[Remodel Flags & Options](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/full-options-list)  
[General Remodel Tutorial](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/design/Remodel)  
[Stanford Rosetta Workshop](http://2016.rosetta.ninja/day-3/rosettaremodel-basic-tutorial)  
[Loop Modeling Tutorial](https://www.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/loop_modeling/loop_modeling)  
[Disulfide Design Tutorial](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/application_documentation/design/rosettaremodel#algorithm_disulfide-design)  

Most of the documents in this repository are written in Markdown - [here is a quick guide](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) if you are new to it.

## Contents of this repository
**remodel-flags**. A newbie-friendly list of the most commonly used flags in RosettaRemodel.    
**remodel-bugs**. A kind of Stack Overflow for RosettaRemodel. Adding bugs and fixes to this list will hopefully save everyone time in the long run!
