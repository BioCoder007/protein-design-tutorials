# remodel-tutorials
We've assembled some cheat sheets, references, and tutorials for learning to use RosettaRemodel as a command line executable here in this repo. They're meant to supplement, not replace, the documentation kept at RosettaCommons, which is already very well developed. There probably isn't much here that isn't there already, but hopefully this assembles some of the most important knowledge to get you up and running ASAP.

Most of the documents in this repository are written in Markdown - [here is a quick guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you are new to it.

## Contents of this repository
**remodel_overview.md**. An introduction to RosettaRemodel, how it works, and some basic knowledge that will be useful in learning to use it.  
**remodel_flags.md**. A newbie-friendly list of the most commonly used flags in RosettaRemodel.    
**remodel_bugs.md**. A kind of Stack Overflow for RosettaRemodel. Adding bugs and fixes to this list will hopefully save everyone time in the long run!   
**de_novo_design**. A step-by-step tutorial for de novo protein design using Rosetta fragment sampling.  
**ss_remodeling**. A step-by-step tutorial for remodeling the secondary structures (and/or redesigning the sequence) of a segment of an input protein.
